B activation , it interacts with IRAK2 to inhibit translation of cytokines and chemokines Thus , IRAKM exerts an overall inhibitory effect on inflammatory responses Surprisingly , we found IRAKM-deficient mice were protected from ethanol-induced liver injury Array analysis led us to be interested in one particular TLR4-induced IRAKM-dependent gene , Mincle , a C-type lectin receptor , that senses non-homeostatic cell death , thereby inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production Mincle expression was induced in liver of ALD patients and in mice after ethanol feeding in an IRAKM-dependent pathway Further , Mincle-deficient mice were protected from ethanol-induced liver injury Since Mincle is a sensor for cell death and its expression is IRAKM-dependent , we hypothesize that TLR-induced IRAKM-dependent Mincle up-regulation in Kupffer cells provides a critical link between alcohol-induced cell death and onset of inflammatory responses , contributing to the pathogenesis of ALD To test this hypothesis , we propose the following Aims Aim 1 Investigate the mechanism for TLR-mediated IRAKM-dependent pathway in ALD we will investigate \\( 1 \\) The molecular mechanism for the TLR-MyD88-IRAKM-MEKK3-dependent pathway induced by low dose of TLR ligands \\( 2 \\) The mechanism for the pathogenic role of the TLR-MyD88-IRAKM-MEKK3-dependent pathway in ALD Aim 2 Investigate the mechanism by which Mincle-mediated signaling contributes to ALD We will investigate \\( 1 \\) The molecular mechanism for Mincle-mediated inflammasome activation \\( 2 \\) The cellular mechanism for the pathogenic role of the Mincle-dependent pathway in ALD These combined molecular cellular and pre-clinical studies will identify critical elements in the role of the TLR-IRAK-M-Mincle signaling in ALD , leading to improved therapeutics for prevention and treatment of ALD</td>\n",

SUMMARY Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma \\( LUAD \\) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology Approximately 20 of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 , a negative regulator of NRF2 , which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response Using CRISPR Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we demonstrated that loss of KEAP1 hyper-activates NRF2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD Our data are in line with mounting evidence demonstrating that , contrary to popular belief , antioxidants can promote cancer progression Combining CRISPR Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolic analyses , we have identified novel synthetic lethal interactions in KEAP1 mutant cells We observe that the ability of KEAP1 mutant tumors to divert their metabolism towards antioxidant production comes with a cost , creating metabolic vulnerabilities that may be targeted by novel therapeutic strategies In preliminary studies , we observed a dependency of KEAP1 mutant tumors on the amino acid serine In this application we focus on elucidating this newly appreciated metabolic vulnerability of KRAS-driven KEAP1 mutant tumors to serine and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting serine metabolism in highly relevant pre-clinical mouse and human models This application aims to 1 \\) Determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the serine transporter SLC1A5 and serine uptake in KRAS-driven LUAD models with KEAP1 mutations , 2 \\) Define the metabolic mechanisms underlying serine dependency in LUAD and other KEAP1 mutant cancers , 3 \\) Determine whether dietary serine restriction can selectively affect the growth of KEAP1 mutant tumors , 4 \\) Dissect the metabolic crosstalk of glutamine and serine dependency in cancers with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway Our studies will provide a rationale for sub-stratification of patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to therapies targeting serine metabolism , which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine</td>\n",

DESCRIPTION \\( provided by applicant \\) Alcoholic liver disease \\( ALD \\) is a major source of alcohol-related morbidity and mortality It is estimated that 10-15 percent of alcoholics develop fibrosis , cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma Inflammatory responses are critical contributors to disease progression One important pathway to increased inflammation results from increased intestinal permeability and changes in bacterial microflora , resulting in activation of Toll-like receptor 4 \\( TLR4 \\) on Kupffer cells However , ethanol also directly injures hepatocytes our preliminary data indicate that signals from injured hepatocytes are also critical to the activation of hepatic macrophages The overall objective of this proposal is to investigate how TLR-dependent inflammatory responses , in combination with alcohol-induced hepatocellular injury , coordinately lead to pathogenesis of ALD TLRs transduce their signals through the adaptor molecule MyD88 and members of the IL-1R-associated kinase \\( IRAK \\) family , including IRAK1 , IRAK2 , IRAKM and IRAK4 IRAK4 , the upstream kinase , directly interacts with MyD88 While MyD88- IRAK4-IRAK1 mediates TAK1-dependent NF \\? B activation , MyD88-IRAK4-IRAK2 is critical for post- transcriptional control While IRAKM interacts with MyD88-IRAK4 to mediate a MEKK3-dependent second wave NF \\? B activation , it interacts with IRAK2 to inhibit translation of cytokines and chemokines Thus , IRAKM exerts an overall inhibitory effect on inflammatory responses Surprisingly , we found IRAKM-deficient mice were protected from ethanol-induced liver injury Array analysis led us to be interested in one particular TLR4-induced IRAKM-dependent gene , Mincle , a C-type lectin receptor , that senses non-homeostatic cell death , thereby inducing pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine production Mincle expression was induced in liver of ALD patients and in mice after ethanol feeding in an IRAKM-dependent pathway Further , Mincle-deficient mice were protected from ethanol-induced liver injury Since Mincle is a sensor for cell death and its expression is IRAKM-dependent , we hypothesize that TLR-induced IRAKM-dependent Mincle up-regulation in Kupffer cells provides a critical link between alcohol-induced cell death and onset of inflammatory responses , contributing to the pathogenesis of ALD To test this hypothesis , we propose the following Aims Aim 1 Investigate the mechanism for TLR-mediated IRAKM-dependent pathway in ALD we will investigate \\( 1 \\) The molecular mechanism for the TLR-MyD88-IRAKM-MEKK3-dependent pathway induced by low dose of TLR ligands \\( 2 \\) The mechanism for the pathogenic role of the TLR-MyD88-IRAKM-MEKK3-dependent pathway in ALD Aim 2 Investigate the mechanism by which Mincle-mediated signaling contributes to ALD We will investigate \\( 1 \\) The molecular mechanism for Mincle-mediated inflammasome activation \\( 2 \\) The cellular mechanism for the pathogenic role of the Mincle-dependent pathway in ALD These combined molecular cellular and pre-clinical studies will identify critical elements in the role of the TLR-IRAK-M-Mincle signaling in ALD , leading to improved therapeutics for prevention and treatment of ALD   \n",

SUMMARY Treating KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma \\( LUAD \\) remains a major challenge for clinical oncology Approximately 20 of KRAS mutant LUAD tumors carry loss-of-function mutations in KEAP1 , a negative regulator of NRF2 , which is the master transcriptional regulator of the endogenous antioxidant response Using CRISPR Cas9-based somatic editing in a genetically engineered mouse model of KRAS-driven LUAD we demonstrated that loss of KEAP1 hyper-activates NRF2 and dramatically accelerates KRAS-driven LUAD Our data are in line with mounting evidence demonstrating that , contrary to popular belief , antioxidants can promote cancer progression Combining CRISPR Cas9-based genetic screening and metabolic analyses , we have identified novel synthetic lethal interactions in KEAP1 mutant cells We observe that the ability of KEAP1 mutant tumors to divert their metabolism towards antioxidant production comes with a cost , creating metabolic vulnerabilities that may be targeted by novel therapeutic strategies In preliminary studies , we observed a dependency of KEAP1 mutant tumors on the amino acid serine In this application we focus on elucidating this newly appreciated metabolic vulnerability of KRAS-driven KEAP1 mutant tumors to serine and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting serine metabolism in highly relevant pre-clinical mouse and human models This application aims to 1 \\) Determine the therapeutic potential of inhibiting the serine transporter SLC1A5 and serine uptake in KRAS-driven LUAD models with KEAP1 mutations , 2 \\) Define the metabolic mechanisms underlying serine dependency in LUAD and other KEAP1 mutant cancers , 3 \\) Determine whether dietary serine restriction can selectively affect the growth of KEAP1 mutant tumors , 4 \\) Dissect the metabolic crosstalk of glutamine and serine dependency in cancers with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway Our studies will provide a rationale for sub-stratification of patients with hyperactivation of the NRF2 pathway as treatment responders to therapies targeting serine metabolism , which is pertinent to the goals of precision medicine   \n",
